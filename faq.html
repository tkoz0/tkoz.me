        <h1>FAQ: (in)frequently asked questions</h1>
        <h3>Why does this website look so bad?</h3>
        <p>Because web development is not interesting to me and
            I prefer the "simplicity" in appearance of very basic HTML/CSS.
            I also like when pages load fast and are not resource heavy.</p>
