        <h1>FAQ: (in)frequently asked questions</h1>
        <h3>Why does this website look so bad?</h3>
        <p>Because I prefer the "simplicity" in appearance of very basic HTML/CSS and pages that load fast.
            I prefer to focus on the content of my pages more than the layout and appearance.</p>
        <p>One website that inspired my preference for "older" style web pages is
            <a href="http://numberworld.org/" target="_blank">http://numberworld.org/</a>, from the author
            of <a href="http://numberworld.org/y-cruncher/" target="_blank">y-cruncher</a>.
            It is not modern looking, rather focusing on content about how to compute Pi and other numerical
            constants to very high precision. The style has not changed since 2011 when I first found this site,
            but its content interests me a lot, which is much more important than its appearance.</p>
