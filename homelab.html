        <p>This page describes my janky homelab setup. Someone has to pay the power bill for this thing... (around $100/month)</p>
        <p>Everything is connected to a cheap 8 port gigabit switch which is connected to a router.
            I have everything on a wooden rack I designed and built myself.
            Some of the equipment is attached to an APC Smart UPS SUA1500RM2U.</p>
        <p>My primary interest with homelabbing is high performance computing (HPC).
            It is also a good opportunity to learn to setup things myself and a much cheaper alternative to cloud computing.
            Used x86_64/amd64 based servers are probably the most power efficient option I have for heavy computing that is not prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <h3>Rimuru (main server)</h3>
        <p>Named after the main character in the anime

            I use this one for data storage and running various services. This was previously used for computation before
            I bought more hard drives to move my data storage from Lacia, the server I used previously for data storage.</p>

        <h3>Lacia (compute server)</h3>
        <p>Named after the character Lacia in the anime <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/100245/BEATLESS/" target="_blank">Beatless</a>.
            I use this one for running heavy computing projects.
            These include my own code, performance experiments, and other various dumb ideas.
            The large amount of storage and RAM make this nice to use for certain applications such as

        <p>Named after the main character from the anime <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/579/Battle-Programmer-Shirase/" target="_blank">Battle Programmer Shirase (BPS)</a>.
            One memory channel is bad. I found this in the trash at RPI and used it for a while before I got the R720xd (named Lacia).
            It used to be an extra server I used for testing software installation/setup to get things working before repeating it.</p>

        <h3>Kurumi (compute server)</h3>
        <p>Primarily named after Kurumi, the hacker character in the anime
            <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/143270/Lycoris-Recoil/" target="_blank">Lycoris Recoil</a>.
            Also happens to be the same name as Kurumi from the anime
            <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/15583/Date-A-Live/" target="_blank">Date A Live</a>.
            This is another compute server, used for CPU bound code with low memory requirements since
            it has a lot less memory and storage than Lacia has.</p>
