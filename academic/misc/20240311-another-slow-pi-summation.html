<h1>Slowly Converging Pi Formula</h1>

<p>
    The following is a well known \(\pi\) formula that comes from the arctangent
    series.
</p>

\[\pi=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{(-1)^k\over2k+1}
={1\over1}-{1\over3}+{1\over5}-{1\over7}+{1\over9}-\ldots\]

<p>
    It converges so slowly and we can see that to approximate \(\pi\) to \(n\)
    digits of precision requires about \(O(10^n)\) terms. One idea to make it
    faster was to combine adjacent terms, but this does nothing significant to
    improve computation of \(\pi\). The idea is to do the following.
</p>

\[4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{(-1)^k\over2k+1}=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{1\over4k+1}
-4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{1\over4k+3}\]

<p>
    This splits the summation into 2 summations for the even and odd indexed
    terms. Then the 2 summations can be combined. All this does is just give
    the same exact approximation of \(\pi\) in half as many terms.
</p>

\[\begin{align}&4\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left({1\over4k+1}-{1\over4k+3}\right)
=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{(4k+3)-(4k+1)\over(4k+1)(4k+3)}\\&
=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty{2\over(4k+1)(4k+3)}
=8\sum_{k=0}^\infty{1\over16k^2+16k+3}\end{align}\]

<p>
    One way to prove this formula is to consider the following integral. This is
    the more significant idea that came from exploring this \(\pi\) formula a
    bit. It provides a way to evaluate similar summations by using integrals.
</p>

\[\begin{align}&
\int_0^1{x^{p-1}\over1-x^4}dx=\int_0^1x^{p-1}(1+x^4+x^8+x^{12}+\ldots)dx\\&
=\int_0^1\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{4k+p-1}\right)dx
=\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty{x^{4k+p}\over4k+p}\right]_0^1
=\sum_{k=0}^\infty{1\over4k+p}
\end{align}\]

<p>
    So the formula written out utilizes this integral with values \(p=1\) and
    \(p=3\).
</p>

\[\begin{align}&
4\int_0^1{dx\over1-x^4}-4\int_0^1{x^2dx\over1-x^4}
=4\int_0^1{(1-x^2)dx\over1-x^4}\\&
=4\int_0^1{(1-x^2)dx\over(1+x^2)(1-x^2)}
=4\int_0^1{dx\over1+x^2}\\&
=4\arctan(x)\Big|_0^1=4\arctan(1)=4{\pi\over4}=\pi
\end{align}\]
