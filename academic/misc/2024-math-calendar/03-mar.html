    The average age group of students and teachers is \(25\).
    The students' average is \(20\). The teachers' average is \(35\).
    Find the ratio of students to teachers.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose there are \(s\) students and \(t\) teachers. Then we know the
    sum of the students' ages is \(20s\) and the sum of the teachers' ages
    is \(35t\). Then when added together, we have the average as
    \(\frac{20s+35t}{s+t}=25\). We can take this equation and find the ratio
    \(s/t\).
</p>

\[\frac{20s+35t}{s+t}=25 \Rightarrow 20s+35t=25(s+t)=25s+25t \Rightarrow
10t=5s \Rightarrow \frac{s}{t}=\frac{10}{5}=2\]

<p>
    Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find
    \(\overline{DF}=\overline{EF}=r\sqrt{5}\). Also, \(\angle DFE\) is a right
    angle so \(\triangle DEF\) is isosceles. We also have that \(\triangle DEF
    \cong\triangle EFB\). This means \(\overline{EB}=r\sqrt{10}\). Next, we find
    \(\overline{CE}\) which when added to \(\overline{EB}\) will give us an
    expression with \(r\) that is equal to \(13/\sqrt{2}\). Consider the
    following triangle taken out of the diagram. We need to find its height
    \(h\), the red segment drawn. This will be the same as \(\overline{CE}\)
    because \(\overline{AC}\parallel\overline{DE}\)
</p>

<p>
    Here \(h\) is an altitude so it splits this right triangle into 2 similar
    right triangles. Using the following ratio, we can find \(h\).
</p>

\[{h\over3r}={r\over r\sqrt{10}} \Rightarrow h={3r\over\sqrt{10}}\]

<p>
    So now \(\overline{CE}+\overline{EB}={3r\over\sqrt{10}}+r\sqrt{10}\). This
    is a leg of the large triangle, having length \(13/\sqrt{2}\) so we solve
    for \(r\).
</p>

\[{3r\over\sqrt{10}}+r\sqrt{10}={13\over\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow
{3r+10r\over\sqrt{10}}={13\over\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow
13r\sqrt{2}=13\sqrt{10} \Rightarrow r=\sqrt{5}\]

<p>
    So now we have \(x=r^2=5\).

\[{36!\over26!}\mod13\]

<p>
    First, take the numbers \(36,35,\ldots,27\) and reduce them modulo \(13\).
    This gives us the following equivalent expression.
</p>

\[10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1\mod13\]

<p>
    From here, multiplying and reducing modulo 13 gets us the answer of 6.

    Find the area bounded by the \(x\)-axis and \(f(x)=4+2x-2x^2\).
</p>

<p>
    This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient and a
    maximum of 4 so the area we are looking for can be found by integrating
    between its zeroes. To find them, factor.
</p>

\[4+2x-2x^2=-2(x^2-x-2)=-2(x+1)(x-2)\]

<p>
    The zeroes are \(-1\) and \(2\). Next, the integral.
</p>

\[\int_{-1}^2(4+2x-2x^2)dx=\left[4x+x^2-{2\over3}x^3\right]_{-1}^2

={1\over4}{1\over8}+{2\over4}{3\over8}+{1\over4}{3\over8}={10\over32}\]

\[x&gt;y,x&gt;0,y&gt;0,x^2+y^2=122,x+y+xy=23\]

<p>
    This turns out to be the intersection of a hyperbola and circle. The
    "big brain" reasoning with observing that \(122=11^2+1^2\) leads to noticing
    that the numbers work out nicely. But in general, it's not too easy to find
    solutions for intersections of general quadratic curves. We normally have to
    do some form of substituting one variable in place of the other. First,
    rewrite one of the equations.
</p>

\[x+y+xy=23\Rightarrow y(1+x)=23-y\Rightarrow y={23-x\over1+x}\]

<p>
    Now substitute this into the circle equation. Prepare for some algebra mess.
</p>

\[\begin{align}&
x^2+\left({23-x\over1+x}\right)^2=122\\&
x^2(1+x)^2+(23-x)^2=122(1+x)^2\\&
x^4+2x^3+x^2+529-46x+x^2=122=244x+122x^2\\&
x^4+2x^3-120x^2-290x+407=0
\end{align}\]

<p>
    This is difficult to factor. The rational root theorem helps us find
    \(x=1\) and \(x=11\), so we factor it to this.
</p>

\[(x-1)(x-11)(x^2+14x+37)=0\]

<p>
    The quadratic part is positive when \(x\) is positive so it will not give
    any solutions we care about. The only solutions in positive \(x\) are
    \(x=1\) and \(x=11\) which correspond to \(y=11\) and \(y=1\) respectively.
    Finally, we take the solution where \(x&gt;y\) so \(x=11\).

<p>
    This problem is confusing as worded and solving it is still a mystery. The
    least weird explanation I have seen is that it should actually be how many
    triangles are congruent to at least one other, so the big triangle is
    excluded since there is only 1 and the others are counted so \(3+9=12\).

    Find the smallest postage value that cannot be placed on an envelope using
    at most three stamps worth 1, 2, or 5 cents.
</p>

<p>
    We can solve this by brute force. With one stamp, we have \(1,2,5\) as
    possibilities. Then for 2 stamps, add 1, 2, or 5 to any of these values.
    The list of possibilities for 2 stamps is 2,3,4,6,7,10. Then we repeat
    for the list of possibilities for 3 stamps which is
    3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15. Now we combine these numbers into a new list so the
    possible postage values are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15. The smallest that
    does not appear in this list is 13.

\[\gcd(882,336,980)\]

<p>
    Unfortunately the \(\pi\) day problem does not involve \(\pi\). We can solve

\[\begin{align}&882=2\cdot3^2\cdot7^2\\&336=2^4\cdot3\cdot7\\&
980=2^2\cdot5\cdot7^2\end{align}\]

<p>
    Then by taking the highest prime powers common to all of them, the greatest

    \(S=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\). Find the number of \(U\subset S\) for which
    \(\exists\:a&lt;b&lt;c\) where \(a,c\in U\) and \(b\notin U\).
</p>

<p>
    Consider the opposite of the condition. For every \(a&lt;b&lt;c\) with
    \(a,c\in U\), we have \(b\in U\). This says there are no gaps in the
    ordering of the elements. So we need to subtract this amount from the number
    of nonempty subsets which is \(2^5-1=31\). When 1 is the first, there
    are 5 subsets with no gaps, adding the next integer each time. Starting with
    2, there are 4 subsets. Continuing this reasoning, we have 5+4+3+2+1=15
    contiguous subsets. The answer is \(31-15=16\). In general, if
    \(S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\), then the number of such subsets is
    \(2^n-1-n(n+1)/2\).

    Find the number of positive integer pairs \((a,b),a\leq b\) for which
    \({1\over a}+{1\over b}={1\over72}\).
</p>

<p>
    Since, \(0&lt;a\leq b\), \({1\over a}\geq{1\over b}\). We can use this to
    find bounds for \(a\). Since \({1\over a}+{1\over b}\leq{2\over a}\), we
    have \({2\over a}\geq{1\over72}\Rightarrow a\leq144\). Since
    \({1\over a}={1\over72}-{1\over b}&lt;{1\over72}\), \(a&gt;72\).
</p>

<p>
    Now, let \(a=72+k\) for some \(0&lt;k\leq72\). Then
</p>

\[\begin{align}&
{1\over72+k}+{1\over b}={1\over72} \Rightarrow 72+k+b={(72+k)b\over72} \\&
\Rightarrow 72^2+72k+\cancel{72b}=\cancel{72b}+kb \Rightarrow b={72^2\over k}+72
\end{align}\]

<p>
    Therefore, we need \(k\) to be a factor of \(72^2\) which is below \(72\)
    in order for \(b\) to be an integer. This includes the \(12\) factors of
    \(72\). Since \(72=2^3\cdot3^2\), we can use the prime factorization to find
    factors of \(72^2\) which are below \(72\) and not factors of \(72\):
    \(2^4,2^4\cdot3,2^5,2^6,3^3,2\cdot3^3\). This is \(6\) more factors for a
    total of \(18\) possible values of \(k\). Each choice of \(k\) corresponds
    to the integer pair \(72+k,{72^2\over k}+72\) which satisfies the equation.

<p>
    How many counting numbers under \(400\) have an odd number of factors?
</p>

<p>
    The numbers that have an odd number of factors are all perfect squares. To
    see why, consider the prime factorization \(n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\ldots\).
    The number of factors is \((a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots\) so we would need each of
    these numbers multiplied to be odd, which is equivalent to each power
    \(a_i\) being even. The perfect squares under \(400\) are
    \(1^2,2^2,\ldots,19^2\) so the answer is \(19\).

    Find the number of ways that the vertices of a decagon can be labeled from
    1 to 10 such that the labels on the vertices of any edge differ by no more
    than 2.
</p>

<p>
    Consider where the 1 is put. There are 10 possible vertices to choose. Now,
    the 1 must be next to the 2 and 3. We have 2 ways to put these numbers next
    to the 1. From here, we have a chain of forcing the next pair of numbers.
    The 4 and 5 must go next to the 2 and 3, but there is only 1 way to put them
    so the labels on the same edge differ by no mare than 2. This continues with
    the pair 6,7 and finally the pair 8,9. The last number is 10, which is
    acceptable to put in its final location. Going around the decagon, the order
    is \(8-6-4-2-1-3-5-7-9-10\) where the 10 and 8 connect around. Since we can
    choose 10 places for the 1 and choose 2 arrangements for the 2 and 3 to be
    next to the 1, there are \(10\times2=20\) possible such labelings.

<p>
    The sum of the squares of five consecutive positive integers starting with
    \(x\) is \(2655\).
</p>

<p>
    We can solve this with the sum of squares formula which is:
</p>

\[\sum_{k=1}^nk^2={n(n+1)(2n+1)\over6}\]

<p>
    Let one summation have \(n=x+4\) and the other have \(n=x-1\). By
    subtracting them, we get the sum \(x^2+(x+1)^2+(x+2)^2+(x+3)^2+(x+4)^2\).
</p>

\[\begin{align}&
\sum_{k=1}^{x+4}k^2-\sum_{k=1}^{x-1}k^2
={(x+4)(x+5)(2x+9)\over6}-{(x-1)x(2x-1)\over6}\\&
={1\over6}(30x^2+120x+180)=5x^2+20x+30=2655
\end{align}\]

<p>
    This gives us a quadratic equation: \(5x^2+20x-2625=5(x+25)(x-21)=0\). So
    we must have \(x=21\), the positive solution. The other solution \(x=-25\)
    works if we allow \(x\) to be negative.

\[\sum_{i=1}^{1000}i!\mod143\]

    This reduces the work to computing
</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^{12}i!\mod143\]

<p>
    It requires a little bit of tedious multiplication and division, but work
    can be reused since if \((n-1)!\equiv a\), then \(n!\equiv an\), reducing
    modulo \(143\) at each step. The answer is \(22\).

\[\left(506+(506+x)^{1\over2}\right)^{1\over2}=x\]

<p>
    First square both sides twice with a little adjustment.
</p>

\[\begin{align}& 506+(506+x)^{1\over2}=x^2 \\& (506+x)^{1\over2}=x^2-506 \\&
506+x=x^4-1012x^2+506^2 \\& x^4-1012x^2-x+505\cdot506=0 \end{align}\]

<p>
    Then we could tediously factor this polynomial to get
    \((x-23)(x+22)(x^2+x-505)=0\) which has the solution \(x=23\). We would also
    have to check for extraneous solutions and find that none of the others are
    solutions.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, we can observe that the left side is the function
    \(f(x)=\sqrt{506+x}\) iterated to \(f(f(x))=x\). Since \(f(x)\) is
    monotonic, if we choose \(x\) to be a non fixed point, it will not return to
    \(x\) under iterations of \(f\). To see why,
</p>

\[f(x)&lt;x \Rightarrow f(f(x))&lt;f(x)&lt;x \]

<p>
    Since \(f(x)\) is monotonically increasing and \(y&lt;z\) implies
    \(f(y)&lt;f(z)\). A similar result can be shown for \(f(x)&gt;x\). Thus,
    we must have the fixed point \(f(x)=x\) which is easier to solve for than
    the quartic equation above resulting from an algebra mess.
</p>

\[\sqrt{506+x}=x \Rightarrow 506+x=x^2 \Rightarrow (x+22)(x-23)=0\]

<p>
    We find \(x=-22\) is an extraneous solution since a square root cannot be
    negative so the answer is \(x=23\).

<p>
    Find the number of \(S\subset\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) for which the sum of \(S\)'s
    elements is divisible by 3.
</p>

<p>
    First, split \(S\) into 3 sets by modulo 3:
    \(S_0=\{3,6\},S_1=\{1,4\},S_2=\{2,5\}\). Now we can choose any of the 4
    subsets of \(S_0\) and add it to a subset of \(S_1\cup S_2\) and not change
    its sum modulo 3, so we consider subsets of \(S_1\cup S_2\) which sum to a
    number divisible by 3 and multiply that result by 4. Now consider 3 cases
    for how many elements we pick from \(S_1\). If 0, then we cannot use any of
    \(S_2\) because the sum would be 1 or 2 (mod 3), which is 1 possibility.
    If 1, then we must use exactly 1 element from \(S_2\), so this is 4
    possibilities since there are 2 ways to choose 1 element from a set of 2.
    If 2, then we have to choose both elements in \(S_2\) as well, which is 1
    possibility. This gives us an answer of \(4(1+4+1)=24\). This total includes
    the empty set \(\varnothing\) and \(S\) itself.

\[\left(\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}+2}+\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}-2}\right)^4\]

<p>
    There does not seem to be the nicest solution that does not require pulling
    some numbers out of nowhere. Let \(a=\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}+2}\) and
    \(b=\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}-2}\). Then the quantity we are looking for is
    \((a+b)^4\). We can start by writing \((a+b)^3\). Note that \(ab=1\) which
    can be shown easily.
</p>

\[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3=a^3+b^3+3ab(a+b)
=(\sqrt{5}+2)+(\sqrt{5}-2)+3(a+b)\]

<p>
    Then if we let \(u=a+b\), this can be written as the cubic equation
    \(u^3=2\sqrt{5}+3u\). By some lucky guessing, we can find \(u=\sqrt{5}\) is
    a solution and the other 2 are not real. So the quantity we are looking for
    is \((a+b)^4=u^4=25\).
</p>

<hr />

<p>
    Another thing we can do is relating this problem to another simpler one.
</p>

\[y=\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}}+\sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}\]

<p>
    First, by writing \(y^3\), we will find
</p>

\[y^3=(2+\sqrt{5})+(2-\sqrt{5})
+3\left(\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}}\sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}\right)y\]

<p>
    That part in parenthesis simplifies to \(-1\) so simplifying the equation
    some more gives \(y^3=4-3y\). This is much easier to factor than the other
    polynomial, and we find \(y=1\) with the other 2 solutions not real.
</p>

<p>
    Now how does this relate to the original problem? Notice that
    \(y+2\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}-2}=u\) using \(u\) as defined in the previous work.
    Let \(z=2\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}-2}\). Then we find \(z^3=8\sqrt{5}-16\). The next
    part uses a little pulling stuff out of nowhere. What if we could write
    \(z=c\sqrt{5}-d\) for some numbers \(c,d\)? Well then, \(z^3\) would be
    (if you work out a bit of algebra)
</p>

\[z^3=\sqrt{5}(5c^3+3cd^2)-d^3-15cd^2\]

<p>
    Notice that the coefficients sum nicely, \(5+3=8\) and \(-1-15=-16\) which
    matches the other way we computed \(z^3\). So we have \(c=d=1\) and find
    that \(z=\sqrt{5}-1\). From this, we get the same
    \(u=y+z=1+(\sqrt{5}-1)=\sqrt{5}\) as before.

<p>
    The number of quarters used must be odd, otherwise the amount remaining

    the remaining amount can be created with only dimes. So the smallest number
    of quarters that can be used is 1, and the largest is \(12\cdot4+3=51\).
    Counting these gives us a total of 26 possible amounts of quarters to select

    Find the number of positive integers less than 100 that are not divisible by

<p>
    This can be solved with the inclusion-exclusion principle. Start with all
    positive integers from 1 to 100, then subtract those which are divisible by
    one of the numbers. Some are taken away 2 or 3 times because they are
    divisible by more than 1 of those numbers. So next we add back the numbers
    which are divisible by 2 of them, and finally subtract the ones which are
    divisible by all 3. This works because the 3 numbers given are all prime,
    or more generally pairwise coprime.
