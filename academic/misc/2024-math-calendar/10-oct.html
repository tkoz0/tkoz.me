Let \(H_n\) be the generalized Harmonic numbers. \(x=H_{1\over2}+2\ln(2)\)
</p>

<p>
The harmonic numbers are defined as
\[H_n=1+{1\over2}+{1\over3}+\ldots+{1\over n}=\sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k}\]
The generalized harmonic numbers can be defined from turning this summation into
an integral as follows
\[\begin{align}&\sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k}
=\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\int_0^1x^{k-1}dx\right)
=\int_0^1\left(\sum_{k=1}^nx^{k-1}\right)dx\\
&=\int_0^1\left(1+x+x^2+\ldots+x^{n-1}\right)dx
=\int_0^1{1-x^n\over1-x}dx\end{align}\]
So we can compute this generalized harmonic number as
\[H_{1\over2}=\int_0^1{1-\sqrt{x}\over1-x}dx
=\int_0^1{1-\sqrt{x}\over(1-\sqrt{x})(1+\sqrt{x})}dx
=\int_0^1{dx\over1+\sqrt{x}}\]
Here, substitute \(u=1+\sqrt{x}\) which gives us \(du={dx\over2\sqrt{x}}
\Rightarrow dx=2(u-1)du\). The bounds change to \(u(0)=1,u(1)=2\).
\[\int_1^2{2(u-1)du\over u}=\int_1^2\left(2-{2\over u}\right)du
=\left[2u-2\ln|u|\right]_1^2=2-2\ln(2)\]
Then finally \(x=H_{1\over2}+2\ln(2)=(2-2\ln(2))+2\ln(2)=2\)

Consider the side-angle-side area formula for the "Area=3" triangle. It would be
\({1\over2}ab\sin(\theta)\) where \(a,b\) are \(3,\sqrt{5}\) and \(\theta\) is
its angle next to the point in the middle of the figure. Now the angle right
across it, part of the \(x\) triangle, is \(180^\circ-\theta\). We can apply
the same side-angle-side area formula and only the angle is different because
the adjacent sides are the same \(3,\sqrt{5}\). Therefore,
\(x={1\over2}ab\sin(180^\circ-\theta)\). It turns out that
\(\sin(180^\circ-\theta)=\sin(\theta)\) so it is the same as the "Area=3"
triangle. Therefore, \(x=3\)

What is the maximum area among all rhombuses of side length 2?
</p>

<p>
Intuitively, we would think this is the square, the special case where all the
angles are right angles, which would have area \(2\times2=4\). If we consider
this more rigorously, a parallelogram has area \(ab\sin(\theta)\) where the
side lengths are \(a,b\). The rhombus is the special case where \(a=b\). So the
area of the rhombus in this problem is \(a^2\sin(\theta)=4\sin(\theta)\) and is
maximized when \(\theta=\pi/2\).

<p>
What percent of integers is divisible by 2 and 5 but not 4?
</p>

<p>
Since we are dealing with cardinality of integers, this may be better phrased
in terms of natural density which is the ratio of integers \(1,2,3,\ldots,n\)
satisfying a property as \(n\to\infty\). The ratio of integers divisible by 2
and 5 is \(1/\text{lcm}(2,5)=1/10\) since \(2\mid n\) and \(5\mid n\) implies
\(\text{lcm}(2,5)\mid n\). Then we subtract integers divisible by 10 but not 4.
Any \(10k\) is divisible by 4 when \(k\) is even and not divisible by 4 when
\(k\) is odd. Therefore it is half of these integers. So the ratio we are
looking for is \({1\over10}\times{1\over2}={1\over20}\) which is 5%.

<p>
The largest zero of \(x^4-5x^3-19x^2+29x+42\).
</p>

<p>
The zeroes can be found by the rational root test by testing
\(\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm6,\pm7,\pm14,\pm21,\pm42\). By trial and error, we can find
all the zeroes with this method are \(-1,2,-3,7\) so the largest is \(7\).
</p>

<p>
Another idea for solving this is suppose we can factor it into 2 quadratic
polynomials with integer constants. Then let those constants be a factorization
of 42 and see what happens. It turns out multiple choices work as long as each
factor is the product of 2 of the zeroes. Let's first try \(6\times7=42\).
We would be looking for \(a,b\) such that the polynomial factors to
\[(x^2+ax+6)(x^2+bx+7)\]
This expands to
\[x^4+x^3(a+b)+x^2(13+ab)+x(7a+6b)+42\]
Now using the \(x^3\) and \(x\) terms, we can solve the linear system
\[a+b=-5,\quad7a+6b=29\]
Which has solution
\[a=59,\quad b=-64\]
Then we have to check with the \(x^2\) term to make sure this works, but it does
not since \(13+ab=-3763\). So we try another choice, such as \(3\times14=42\).
\[(x^2+ax+3)(x^2+bx+14)=x^4+x^3(a+b)+x^2(17+ab)+x(14a+3b)+42\]
This time the linear system is
\[a+b=-5,\:14a+3b=29\quad\Rightarrow\quad a=4,\:b=-9\]
And we find \(17+ab=-19\) so this is a valid factorization. Now we can find the
zeroes by factoring quadratic polynomials
\[x^2+4x+3=(x+1)(x+3),\quad x^2-9x+14=(x-2)(x-7)\]

Find the order of the Galois group for \(f(x)=x^4-8x+12\).
</p>

<p>
Solving this problem requires techniques from Galois theory. Some of them are
described <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/45893/how-to-find-the-galois-group-of-a-polynomial" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The discriminant method can be used for part of it. Since \(f(x)\) is a
depressed quartic (missing the \(x^3\) term), the discriminant formula is a
bit simpler. For \(f(x)\), the discriminant is \(-27(-8)^4+256(12)^3=331776\)
(the formula is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page).
Since \(331776=576^2=24^4\), it is a perfect square which shows that the Galois
group of \(f(x)\) is a subgroup of the alternating group \(A_4\) which has
order 12.
</p>

<p>
The next method that can be used is factoring \(f(x)\) over integer fields
modulo a prime that does not divide the discriminant. The following
factorizations were posted on the
<a href="https://x.com/Daily_Epsilon/status/1844981323552768487" target="_blank">Daily Epsilon twitter</a>.
\[f(x)\equiv(x+4)(x^3+x^2+x+3)\mod5\]
\[f(x)\equiv(x^2+8x+4)(x^2+11x+3)\mod19\]
This shows that \(f(x)\) has cycle types \((1,3)\) and \((2,2)\). Therefore,
both 3 and 4 divide the order of the Galois group. Combining both results, the
order must be 12.

Find thet smallest composite number, \(n\), such that there is only one group
of order \(n\).
</p>

<p>
There are many theorems in group theory about properties of groups depending on
the prime factorization of the group order. If the group order can be factored
into distinct primes \(p\times q\) with \(p&lt;q\), there is only 1 group when
\(p\nmid q-1\). If \(p=2\) then \(q-1\) is even so this will not be satisfied.
When \(p=3\) and \(q=5\), then \(q-1=4\) and \(3\nmid4\). So there is only 1
group of order 15 and this is the smallest such composite order group.

Water flows at 2m/s through a pipe of radius 3cm into a pipe of radius
1cm, where it flows at a rate of \(x\) m/s.
</p>

<p>
In order to maintain the same flow rate, the water speed times the pipe area
needs to stay the same. When the radius changes from 3cm to 1cm, the area
becomes \(1/9\) of the original, so the speed must be multiplied by \(9\) to
maintain the flow rate. The new speed is \(x=2\cdot9=18\).

How many rooted trees have \(6\) vertices?
</p>

<p>
This problem can be solved with dynamic programming methods. Let \(T(n)\) be the
number of rooted trees with \(n\) vertices. Then \(T(1)=1\). For \(n\) vertices,
we have a root and subtrees totaling \(n-1\) vertices. The way to form these
subtrees can be counted by partitioning \(n-1\). The recurrence relation is
\[T(n)=\sum_{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_k\in P(n-1)}T(t_1)T(t_2)\ldots T(t_k)\]
where \(P(n-1)\) is all the partitions of \(n-1\). For each number in the
partition, choose one of the possible rooted trees with that many vertices and
that will form one of the subtrees for the \(n\) vertex rooted tree.
The partitions are
<ul>
    <li>\(P(1)=\{(1)\}\)</li>
    <li>\(P(2)=\{(1,1),(2)\}\)</li>
    <li>\(P(3)=\{(1,1,1),(1,2),(3)\}\)</li>
    <li>\(P(4)=\{(1,1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(4)\}\)</li>
    <li>\(P(5)=\{(1,1,1,1,1),(1,1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,2,2),(1,4),(2,3),(5)\}\)</li>
</ul>
Then if we do some tedious calculations we will find
\(T(2)=1,T(3)=2,T(4)=4,T(5)=9,T(6)=20\).

Find the smallest number of congruent squares needed to fill a region that is
\(\sqrt{363}\times\sqrt{12}\).
</p>

<p>
In order for the squares to fill this region, its side lengths must be a
rational ratio.
\[{\sqrt{363}\over\sqrt{12}}={\sqrt{3\cdot11\cdot11}\over\sqrt{2\cdot2\cdot3}}
={11\over2}\]
So if \(n\) squares fill the \(\sqrt{12}\) side length, then \(11n/2\) squares
fill the \(\sqrt{363}\) side length. The smallest \(n\) that makes both integers
is \(2\). So 22 congruent squares are needed at minimum.

What is the largest number divisible by all numbers less than its square root?
</p>

<p>
We can see this is possible with \(1,2,3,4\). Their lowest common multiple is
\(12\) so \(12\) and \(24\) are divisible by all of them. Since
\(4&lt;\sqrt{24}&lt;5\), \(24\) satisfies the required property. Now the
challenging part is to show it is the largest.

<p>
Suppose we have some integer \(N\) such that \(n^2&lt;N\leq(n+1)^2\) for some
integer \(n\geq5\) and require \(N\) is divisible by all of \(1,2,\ldots,n\).
Since \(n\mid N\), either \(N=n(n+1)\) or \(N=n(n+2)\). We must also have
\((n-1)\mid N\). Since \(\gcd(n,n-1)=1\), we also have \(n(n-1)\mid N\). For
the first case (\(N=n(n+1)\)),
\[n(n-1)\mid n(n+1)\Rightarrow(n-1)\mid(n+1)\]
which is impossible because \({n+1\over2}&lt;n-1&lt;n+1\) when \(n\geq5\).
For the second case (\(N=n(n+2)\)),
\[n(n-1)\mid n(n+2)\Rightarrow(n-1)\mid(n+2)\]
which is similarly impossible when \(n\geq5\). If you were to check \(n=4\),
this corresponds to the solution \(N=24\).

<p>
By similar triangles, we have the ratios
\[{x+y\over30}={6\sqrt{11}\over h}\]
We can find \(x+y\) with the pythagorean theorem
\[30^2+\left(6\sqrt{11}\right)^2=(x+y)^2\Rightarrow x+y=36\]
Then using this we find \(h=5\sqrt{11}\) by substituting. Now use another
similar triangles ratio
\[{x+y\over6\sqrt{11}}={6\sqrt{11}\over y}\Rightarrow y(x+y)=36\cdot11
\Rightarrow y=11\]
Then \(x=36-y=25\)

The sum of two numbers is \(34\). Their product is \(120\). Find their
difference.
</p>

<p>
This can be written as a quadratic equation. Let \(a,b\) be the numbers so we
have \(a+b=34\) and \(ab=120\). Then \(a^2+ab=34a\Rightarrow a^2-34a+120=0\)
which can be solved by factoring \((a-30)(a-4)=0\). Therefore, \(a=4,30\).
Since the equations are symmetric, we expect this to correspond to \(b=30,4\)
which is correct. The difference is \(30-4=26\).

<p>
The sum of angles is \(360^\circ\) for a quadrilateral so \(x+94+72+163=360\).
We can solve this for \(x=31\).
