<h2>Problem 41</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the largest \(n\) digit pandigital prime (uses each
    digits 1 through \(n\) exactly once).
</p>

<p>
    We can try some manually. \(1,12,21\) are all not prime. In fact, the
    solution must be 4 or 7 digits long. If it were any other length, the digit
    sum would be divisible by 3, which makes the number divisible by 3. We can
    utilize Python's itertools to try all the permutations for 4 and 7 digit
    pandigital numbers. We could be slightly more efficient if we restrict which
    ones digit the permutations have, but we won't go that far here.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
from itertools import permutations

def prime(n):
    if n &lt; 4:
        return n == 2 or n == 3
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    d = 3
    while d*d &lt;= n:
        if n % d  == 0:
            return False
        d += 2
    return True

    n = int(''.join(perm))

<h2>Problem 42</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Using <a href="data_files/0042_words.txt">words.txt</a>,
    count how many words have a letter sum equal to a triangle number.
    (A=1,B=2,...,Z=26)
</p>

<p>
    Since the numbers will be small, we don't have to be fancy about how we test
    if the numbers are triangle numbers, but we can take that opportunity to
    describe a way to do it. The \(n\)th triangle number is
    \(t_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). If we multiply each side by 2, then we can observe
    the following:
</p>

\[\begin{align}&n^2&lt;2t_n=n^2+n&lt;n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2\\
&\Rightarrow n&lt;\sqrt{2t_n}&lt;n+1\end{align}\]

<p>
    So if we let \(n=\lfloor\sqrt{2t_n}\rfloor\), we will find \(2t_n=n(n+1)\).
    This lets us identify triangle numbers.
</p>

<h2>Problem 43</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the sum of all 0-9 pandigital numbers (numbers with
    each digit exactly once) that satisfy the following properties for 3 digit
    substrings (where the digits are \(d_1d_2\ldots d_{10}\)).
</p>

<ul>
    <li>\(d_2d_3d_4\) is divisible by 2</li>
    <li>\(d_3d_4d_5\) is divisible by 3</li>
    <li>\(d_4d_5d_6\) is divisible by 5</li>
    <li>\(d_5d_6d_7\) is divisible by 7</li>
    <li>\(d_6d_7d_8\) is divisible by 11</li>
    <li>\(d_7d_8d_9\) is divisible by 13</li>
    <li>\(d_8d_9d_{10}\) is divisble by 17</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This would be doable by brute force trying all \(10!\) permutations of the
    digits, but there are better ways. For example, if \(d_4\) is odd, then we
    won't have \(d_2d_3d_4\) divisible by 2, so that would eliminate half of
    the permutations. By recursively building the permutations left to right,
    we can eliminate many possibilities early when the divisibility properties
    aren't satisfied.

There are 6 such numbers:
1460357289, 1430952867, 1406357289, 4160357289, 4130952867, 4106357289</details>

<h2>Problem 44</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the minimum value \(D=|P_k-P_j|\) where \(P_j+P_k\) and
    \(D\) are pentagonal numbers. The pentagonal numbers are
    \(P_n=n(3n-1)/2\) with \(n&gt;0\).
</p>

<p>
    First, we can come up with a way to test if a number is pentagonal simila to
    in problem 42. The using \(2P_n=n(3n-1)\), we have the following inequality:
</p>

\[(n-1)^2&lt;\frac{2P_n}{3}=n^2-\frac{n}{3}&lt;n^2\]

<p>
    Checking the left side, we can verify that it is true for \(n&gt;3/5\). So
    we set \(n=\lceil2P_n/3\rceil\) to test. The following code begins with
    \(k=2\) going up, and for each \(k\), tests \(j&lt;k\) to find solutions.
    Once a solution is found, it is used as a bound to speed up the remainder
    to ensure there is no better solution. It finds a single solution somewhat
    quickly, but takes significantly longer to finish the loop to be sure there
    is no better solution.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
from math import sqrt,ceil
P = lambda n : n*(3*n-1)//2

def pentagonal(x):
    n = ceil(sqrt(2*x/3))
    return 2*x == n*(3*n-1)

# find a solution and continue until a better one is not possible
k = 2
minD = 0
while True:
    Pk = P(k)
    if minD != 0 and Pk - P(k-1) &gt; minD:
        break
    for j in range(k-1,0,-1):
        Pj = P(j)
        D = Pk - Pj
        # stop if a solution was found already and D is too big
        if minD != 0 and D &gt; minD:
            break
        S = Pk + Pj
        if pentagonal(D) and pentagonal(S):
            minD = D
            print(f'solution D={D} with j={j},k={k}')
            break
    k += 1
print(f'terminated main loop at k={k}')
print(minD)
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here is another method based on ideas found in the Project Euler forum.
    Try \(i=1,i=2,i=3,\ldots\) as an index for the pentagonal number \(D=P_i\).
    Now search for \(j,k\) so we have \(D=P_k-P_j\). We can use some necessary
    conditions to reduce the search space, and since \(D\) goes up, we are
    searching for a solution in order and can stop as soon as we find one.
    First we write out \(D\) to find necessary conditions of \(d=k-j\).
</p>

\[\begin{align}
&D=P_i=P_k-P_j=P_{j+d}-P_j=\frac{(j+d)(3j+3d-1)}{2}-\frac{j(3j-1)}{2}\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\left(3j^2+3jd+3jd+3d^2-j-d-3j^2+j\right)=3jd+\frac{1}{2}(3d^2-d)\\
&=3jd+\frac{d(3d-1)}{2}=3jd+P_d \Rightarrow j=\frac{P_i-P_d}{3d}
\end{align}\]

<p>
    Since \(j\) is a positive integer, \(P_i-P_d&gt;0 \) and \(3|(P_i-P_d)\).
    The first implies \(0&lt;d&lt;i\). For the other, we have:
</p>

\[P_i\equiv P_d \Rightarrow \frac{i(3i-1)}{2}\equiv\frac{d(3d-1)}{2}
\Rightarrow i(3i-1)\equiv d(3d-1) \Rightarrow i\equiv d\pmod{3}\]

<p>
    We have used the property that 2 is invertible modulo 3, so we multiplied
    each side by 2 and then by inverse of 2 (which is 2) because
    \(3i-1\equiv3d-1\equiv2\pmod{3}\). Therefore, we must have \(0&lt;d&lt;i\)
    and \(i\equiv d\pmod{3}\). Now we have to find a way to pick \(j,k\), which
    will also lead us to another significant reduction of search space.
</p>

\[\begin{align}
&D=P_i=P_k-P_j=\frac{k(3k-1)}{2}-\frac{j(3j-1)}{2}=\frac{i(3i-1)}{2}\\
&\Rightarrow i(3i-1)=k(3k-1)-j(3j-1)=3k^2-3j^2-k+j\\
&=3(k^2-j^2)-(k-j)=3(k+j)(k-j)-(k-j)\\
&=(k-j)(3(k+j)-1)=d(3(k+j)-1)=2P_i\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
    This tells us that \(d|2P_i\), equivalently \(d|i(3i-1)\). Since
    \(\gcd(i,3i-1)=1\), we can find the divisors more easily. We find the
    divisors of each \(i\) and \(3i-1\) as 2 separate lists. Then we form
    divisors of \(i(3i-1)\) by multiplying 2 numbers, 1 taken from each list.
    It is much faster to factor 2 numbers of half as many digits.
</p>

<p>
    So putting all this together, we start a loop at \(i=1\). For each \(i\),
    find the divisors \(d\) of \(i(3i+1)\) such that \(i\equiv d\pmod{3}\) and
    \(0&lt;d&lt;i\). Then for each \(d\) do the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Let \(t_1=2P_i/d\). This value is supposed to be \(3(k+j)-1\).
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(t_1\not\equiv2\pmod{3}\), skip this \(d\). Otherwise, set
        \(t_2=(t_1+1)/3\). This is supposed to be \(k+j\).
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(t_2+d\equiv0\pmod{2}\), then we can get \(k=(t_2+d)/2\), otherwise
        skip this \(d\).
    </li>
    <li>
        Then we get \(j=k-d\), since \(d=k-j\). This value must be positive,
        otherwise skip this \(d\).
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, test if \(P_k+P_j\) is pentagonal. If yes, we have found a
        solution.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    This was a lot of math and a bit of a complicated algorithm. There are a lot
    of parts so thet code is a bit longer and may take a while to understand.

<h2>Problem 45</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> The smallest number that is triangle, pentagonal, and
    hexagonal is \(T_{285}=P_{165}=H_{143}=40755\). Find the next such number.
    (Note: \(T_n=n(n+1)/2,P_n=n(3n-1)/2,H_n=n(2n-1)\) where \(n&gt;0\))
</p>

<p>
    First, we will look at a similar way to test if a number is hexagonal
    (we already found one for triangle and pentagonal numbers in previous
    problems). Then we will look at a different method for all 3 types.
    For \(n&gt;2/3\), the following is true:
</p>

\[(n-1)^2&lt;\frac{H_n}{2}=n^2-\frac{n}{2}&lt;n^2
\Rightarrow n-1&lt;\frac{H_n}{2}&lt;n^2\]

<p>
    We can also use the quadratic formula to identify a way to test for these
    number types, taking the positive answer only.
</p>

\[x=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\Rightarrow n^2+n-2x=0\Rightarrow
n=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+8x}}{2}\]

\[x=\frac{n(3n-1)}{2}\Rightarrow 3n^2-n-2x=0\Rightarrow
n=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+24x}}{6}\]

\[x=n(2n-1)\Rightarrow 2n^2-n-x=0\Rightarrow
n=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+8x}}{4}\]

<p>
    This tells us that for triangle numbers, we need \(D_T=\sqrt{1+8x}\) to be
    an integer and \(D_T\equiv1\pmod{2}\). For pentagonal numbers, we need
    \(D_P=\sqrt{1+24x}\) to be an integer and \(D_P\equiv5\pmod{6}\). Finally,
    for hexagonal numbers, we need \(D_H=\sqrt{1+8x}\) to be an integer and
    \(D_H\equiv3\pmod{4}\). Notice how \(D_T=D_H\). It corresponds to a triangle
    number for every odd value and a hexagonal number for every value congruent
    to 3 modulo 4. If we let \(m=2n-1\), then we can see:
</p>

\[T_m=\frac{m(m+1)}{2}=\frac{(2n-1)(2n)}{2}=n(2n-1)=H_n\]

<p>
    Since every hexagonal number is a triangle number, we can just try hexagonal
    numbers and already have 2 of the 3 types satisfied. We just have to test
    for pentagonal numbers, which we can do with the quadratic formula method.

<p>
    It is more complicated, but much faster to find an efficient solution to a
    diophantime equation. We are looking for \(n,m\) such that \(H_n=P_m\). A
    simpler diophantime equation can be created with some use of completing the
    square.
</p>

\[\begin{align}
&H_n=P_m \Rightarrow 4n^2-2n=3m^2-m
\Rightarrow n^2-\frac{n}{2}=\frac{1}{4}\left(3m^2-m\right) \\
&\Rightarrow \left(n-\frac{1}{4}\right)^2-\frac{1}{16}
=\frac{1}{4}\left(3m^2-m\right) \Rightarrow \left(4n-1\right)^2-1
=4\left(3m^2-m\right) \\
&\Rightarrow \frac{1}{12}\left(4n-1\right)^2-\frac{1}{12}=m^2-\frac{m}{3}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{12}\left(4n-1\right)^2-\frac{1}{12}
=\left(m-\frac{1}{6}\right)^2-\frac{1}{36} \\
&\Rightarrow 3(4n-1)^2-3=(6m-1)^2-1 \Rightarrow
(6m-1)^2-3(4n-1)^2=-2 \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
    Now set \(x=6m-1\) and \(y=4n-1\) and we have \(x^2-3y^2=-2\) which is
    similar to Pell's equation. This is a case of solving a hyperbolic quadratic
    diophantine equation. A method of solving these is described at
    <a href="https://www.alpertron.com.ar/METHODS.HTM#Hyperb" target="_blank"> this website</a>
    which is supposedly implemented in
    <a href="https://www.alpertron.com.ar/QUAD.HTM" target="_blank">this calculator</a>.
    When finding a \((x,y)\) pair that solves it, we check if we can solve for
    \(m\) and \(n\) as integers. We start with the trivial solution
    \((x_0,y_0)=(1,1)\). Then further solutions in positive \(x\) and \(y\) are
    found with the following step (written in matrix notation, taken from the
    calculator linked from here):
</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix}x_{n+1}\\y_{n+1}\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}2&3\\1&2\\\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_n\\y_n\\\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>
    Although I am not quite sure about the proof, this method should generate
    all solutions. There is another way to see it, based on the content of this
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>.
    Using Brahmagupta's identity, we take a triple \((x,y,-2)\) (a solution to
    \(x^2-3y^2=-2\)) and the triple \((2,1,1)\) which is a solution to the
    slightly different equation \(x^2-3y^2=1\). Then if we compose the 2 triples
    to form another, we get \((2x+3y,x+2y,-2)\) which is the same as the matrix
    notation above.
</p>

<p>
    Below is an implementation in code.

<h2>Problem 46</h2>

    <b>Problem:</b> Find the smallest counterexample to Christian Goldbach's
    conjecture (proven false): every odd composite number is the sum of a prime
    and twice of a square.
</p>

<p>
    This problem does not seem to have any obvious room for optimization so we
    use a brute force double loop, the outer for odd composites, and the inner
    for a square number.

<h2>Problem 47</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the smallest of the first 4 consecutive integers that
    each have 4 distinct prime factors.
</p>

<p>
    For this problem, brute force is an option, but a modification to the sieve
    of Eratosthenes does better. The only issue is that we are not sure how big
    the answer is, so we don't know how big the sieve has to be in advance.
</p>

<p>
    In the sieve of Eratosthenes, we start with a prime \(p\) and cross out
    multiples starting at \(p^2\). In our modification, we have a counter for
    each number in the sieve. For each prime \(p\), add 1 to this counter for
    each multiple \(p,2p,3p,\ldots\) to indicate that it has this prime factor.
    The way we tell a number is prime is if it is the first 0 in the sieve,
    indicating that its counter was not incremented for any smaller prime
    factor.
</p>

<p>
    The code below can be modified easily for other amounts of consecutive
    numbers or a different number of distinct prime factors. The sieve size is
    given a default size of 100000 which is too small, so it is enlarged once
    to 200000 which is sufficient to find the solution.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
num_consec = 4
num_factors = 4

sieve_size = 100000 # arbitrary starting sieve size
while True:
    print(f'trying sieve size {sieve_size}')
    answer_found = False
    # sieve for counting distinct prime factors
    sieve = [0]*sieve_size
    for i in range(2,sieve_size):

            sieve[j] += 1 # numbers which have this prime factor
    # search for a solution
    consec = 0 # count consecutive
    for i in range(2,sieve_size):
        if sieve[i] == num_factors:
            consec += 1
        else:
            consec = 0 # reset counter
        if consec &gt;= num_consec:
            print(i - (num_consec - 1))
            answer_found = True

<h2>Problem 48</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the last 10 digits of the following:
    \(1^1+2^2+3^3+\ldots+1000^{1000}\).
</p>

<p>
    Large integer arithmetic in Python allows us to easily solve this in 1 line:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
print(sum(x**x for x in range(1,1+1000)) % 10**10)
</code></pre>

<p>
    Using modular arithmetic, we can just take the last 10 digits of each number
    being added, which is possible with another function in Python:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
print(sum(pow(x,x,10**10) for x in range(1,1+1000)) % 10**10)
</code></pre>

<p>
    If we write the modular exponentiation code ourselves, one way to compute
    \(x^x\pmod{10^{10}}\) is to start with \(x\) and multiply it \(x-1\) more
    times, reducing modulo \(10^{10}\) each time. There is a faster way known
    as modular exponentiation by squaring. More generally, suppose we want to
    compute \(b^p\pmod{m}\). We can start with \(b\) and repeatedly square it
    to get \(b^1,b^2,b^4,b^8,\ldots\). These correspond to binary digits. If we
    have the binary representation of \(p=d_0+d_1\cdot2+d_2\cdot2^2+\ldots\),
    then \(p\) is a sum of powers of 2 (where the digits are 1). Now when we
    compute \(b^p\), it is equal to the product of some of those powers from
    the repeated squaring. All these operations can be reduced modulo \(m\) so
    we never have to handle very large integers.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
def modexp(b,p,m):
    sq = b # b^1,b^2,b^4,b^8,...
    ret = 1
    while p != 0:
        if p % 2 == 1:
            ret = (ret * sq) % m
        p //= 2 # shift to next binary digit
        sq = (sq * sq) % m
    return ret

print(sum(modexp(x,x,10**10) for x in range(1,1+1000)) % 10**10)

<h2>Problem 49</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> The arithmetic sequence 1487, 4817, 8147 has a step size of
    3330 and satisfies the 2 properties below. Find the other increasing
    arithmetic sequence of 3 4-digit numbers that satisfies both properties and
    give the answer as the 3 number concatenated together.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each term is prime</li>
    <li>Each term is a permutation of the same digits</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This could be done by brute force, but since we know each term must be a
    permutation of the same digits, we can generate all permutations for
    selections of digits. There are only \({10+3\choose4}=715\) ways to choose
    4 digits (combinations with replacement) and up to 24 ways to create numbers
    from them. Collect the 4 digit numbers which are prime, and sort them. Then
    pick 2 and see if the 3rd in an arithmetic sequence is also one of them.
    This is fast enough for 4 digit numbers. The code below utilizes some of
    Python's itertools.

<h2>Problem 50</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the prime below 1000000 that can be written as a sum
    of the most consecutive primes.
</p>

<p>
    Since we need a lot of primes, we can use a sieve of Eratosthenes to produce
    them. Since we need to add consecutive primes, we can form a list of the
    primes from the sieve. Then we pick a starting point and add consecutive
    primes, testing primality of the sum. We can stop once the sum reaches
    1000000. We can also stop if our starting number times the maximum length
    found so far reaches 1000000.
