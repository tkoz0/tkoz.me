<h2>Problem 21</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Let \(d(n)\) be the sum of divisors of \(n\) smaller than
    \(n\) for \(n>0\). Two numbers \(a\neq b\) are amicable if \(d(a)=b\) and
    \(d(b)=a\). Find the sum of all amicable numbers below 10000.
</p>

<p>
    This can be done be done by brute force, but we will focus on a better
    method for this problem after discussing ways to sum divisors. Let
    \(n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\ldots\) be a prime factorization. In a previous
    problem, we showed that we can count divisors as \((a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots\).
    We can sum divisors similarly. If we write out the product
    \((1+p_1+p_1^2+\ldots+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+\ldots+p_2^{a_2})\ldots\) then
    we can see after distributing, each term will be a divisor. We select an
    acceptable power of each prime factor to form a divisor, and sum them all
    together. The only thing to be careful of here is that it also counts \(n\),
    and \(d(n)\) as given does not, so we just subtract \(n\). We can also sum
    divisors with a loop up to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), similar to a method
    we looked at for counting them in a previous problem.
</p>

<p>
    So now that we understand how we could do this by brute force, we can focus
    on a faster method. Since the numbers we are concerned with are consecutive,
    we can use something like the sieve of Eratosthenes. Instead of marking
    primality, we sum the divisors. We start at 2, then add it to the counters
    for 4, 6, 8, and so on since 2 is a proper divisor of those. Then for 3, we
    add 3 to the counter for 6, 9, 12, and so on. This goes on up to half of our
    limit.
</p>

<p>
    An additional consideration for the sieve is to go past the limit of 10000
    because there are going to be quite a few highly divisible numbers with a
    divisor sum greater than itself. If we sieve considerably bigger, we avoid
    having to perform a more expensive calculation to sum divisors for as many
    numbers. For the code here, we sieve to 1.5 times the limit. In the case
    that the divisor sum goes above the sieve limit, we utilize another function
    to sum divisors.
</p>

def sum_divisors(n):
    total = 0
    d = 1
    while d*d &lt; n:
        if n % d == 0:

            total += n//d
        d += 1

    b = sieve[a]
    if b &lt;= a:
        continue # require a &lt; b to avoid counting twice
    # make sure sieve[b] = a (if b is small enough)

        if sieve[b] != a:

    This problem isn't as mathy as a lot of the others. The main part is sorting

<h2>Problem 23</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> A number \(n\) is abundant if the sum of its divisors less
    than \(n\) is larger than \(n\). All integers greater than 28123 are the sum
    of 2 abundant numbers. Find the sum of all positive integers which are not
    the sum of 2 abundant numbers.
</p>

<p>
    First we find all abundant numbers by summing divisors. This can be sped up
    a bit by observing that in \(n\) is abundant, then \(an\) is abundant for
    any positive integer \(a\) because if \(d|n\) then \(ad|an\) so the sum of
    divisors of \(an\) is at least \(a\) times the sum of divisors of \(n\).
</p>

<p>
    Next we collect the abundant numbers into a list and use a double loop to
    find all possible numbers up to 28123 which are the sum of 2 abundant
    numbers. From here, we just have to sum the ones which were not possible to
    create by adding 2 of the abundant numbers.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
def sum_divisors(n):
    total = 0
    d = 1
    while d*d &lt; n:
        if n % d == 0:
            total += d
            total += n//d
        d += 1
    if d*d == n: # perfect square
        total += d
    return total

L = 28123
abundant = [False]*(L+1)
for n in range(1,L+1):
    # only consider unmarked numbers for possible abundance
    if not abundant[n] and sum_divisors(n) - n &gt; n:
        for m in range(n,L+1,n):
            abundant[m] = True

# make a list of abundant numbers and double loop for sums
abundantlist = [i for i in range(L+1) if abundant[i]]
print(f'abundant number list has {len(abundantlist)} numbers')
abundantsum = [False]*(L+1)
for i in range(len(abundantlist)):
    for j in range(i,len(abundantlist)):
        # check bound to terminate inner loop early
        s = abundantlist[i] + abundantlist[j]
        if s &gt; L:
            break
        abundantsum[s] = True

nonabundantsums = [i for i in range(L+1) if not abundantsum[i]]
print(f'largest non abundant sum number is {max(nonabundantsums)}')
print(sum(nonabundantsums))
</code></pre>

<p>
    Note: there is a proof that all integers greater than 28123 are the sum of
    2 abundant numbers
    <a href="https://mathschallenge.net/view/sum_of_two_abundant_numbers" target="_blank">here</a>.
    This bound can be lowered to 20161 as stated on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
    The code finds 6965 abundant numbers and confirms the result stated on
    Wikipedia.

<h2>Problem 24</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> What is the 1000000th lexicographic permutation of the
    digits 0-9?
</p>

<p>
    Since there are only 10 digits and \(10!=3628800\), we could list all
    permutations and sort them, but there are more clever methods. Here is the
    very basic solution which utilizes the permutations function in Python:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
from itertools import permutations
index = 1000000
perms = list(permutations('0123456789'))
print(''.join(perms[index-1]))
</code></pre>

<p>
    We can reduce the memory requirement by generating the permutations in
    order. This can be done recursively by selecting digits in order:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
digits = set('0123456789')
I = 1000000
index = 0
def recur(perm):
    global index,digits
    if len(digits) == 0: # selected all 10 in some order
        index += 1
        if index == I:
            print(perm)
    elif index >= I: # terminate early
        return
    else:
        for d in sorted(digits):
            digits.remove(d) # select a digit
            recur(perm+d)
            digits.add(d) # backtrack
recur('')
</code></pre>

<p>
    Another way is to use an algorithm for advancing a permutation to the next,
    which also has low memory requirements. We start with the lowest permutation
    and then repeat the following to increment it to the next permutation:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Identify all contiguous items at the end that are in reverse order. If
        this is all of them, then we are at the lexicographically highest
        permutation. Let \(i\) be the index 1 before this section. For examaple,
        if we had \(4,2,5,3,1\), then we would have \(i=1\) (0-indexing) because
        the digits after it \(5,3,1\) are decreasing and we cannot extend this
        further.
    </li>
    <li>
        Find the smallest item past index \(i\) which is lexicographically
        larger than \(i\). There will exist one because of how we chose \(i\).
        If item \(i\) were larger than the others, we could extend the
        contiguous decreasing part which means we would have chosen \(i\) to be
        smaller in step 1. Let this other item be at index \(j\). Swap the items
        at indexes \(i,j\).
    </li>
    <li>
        After swapping \(i,j\), everything after index \(i\) will still be in
        decreasing order. So what we have done is increase \(i\) to the next
        item because we can't go to a lexicographically higher permutation by
        rearranging the items after it. Next, we reorder the items after index
        \(i\) to increasing order, which is simply reversing the order of them.
    </li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-python">
digits = list('0123456789')
I = 1000000
index = 1
while index &lt; I: # loop to advance permutation
    # decrease i until the digits stop increasing
    i = len(digits)-1
    while i != 0 and digits[i-1] &gt;= digits[i]:
        i -= 1
    # choose i to be 1 before this
    i -= 1
    if i == -1: # the permutation is lexicographically highest
        break
    # choose digits[j] to be the smallest digit after digits[i]
    j = len(digits)-1
    while digits[j] &lt;= digits[i]:
        j -= 1
    # swap these indexes
    digits[i],digits[j] = digits[j],digits[i]
    # finally, reverse the order of everything after index i
    i += 1
    j = len(digits)-1
    while i &lt; j:
        digits[i],digits[j] = digits[j],digits[i]
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    index += 1
print(''.join(digits))
</code></pre>

<p>
    Finally, we can do this with combinatorics. It's a little easier since the
    digits are unique. Furthermore, this is a small enough amount of work that
    it can be done by hand. What is the first digit of the answer? If it is 0,
    then we only have permutations 1 through \(9!=362880\) possible, not enough
    to reach 1000000. If the first digit is 1, then the next \(9!\) permutations
    are possible, still not enough. The first digit must be 2 because
    permutations \(2\times9!+1\) through \(3\times9!\) are possible, which
    includes 1000000. So we choose 2 as the first digit and repeat this method
    to determine which digit should be the 2nd. It turns out to be 7, which
    gives us a permutation index range of \(2\times9!+6\times8!+1\) through
    \(2\times9!+7\times8!\). Below is a table showing the work:

    Repeating the steps over and over, we can choose the digits and narrow the
    permutation index range until we have the right one. To automate this in
    code, at each step we would look at how many jumps of size (number of
    remaining digits) factorial to take.

<h2>Problem 25</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the index of the first Fibonacci number to have 1000
    digits.
</p>

<p>
    The brute force way is to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and test the
    length of the numbers until we get 1000 digits. Here is an example that
    keeps track of the last 2 numbers as arrays starting with least significant
    digit.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
L = 1000
a = [0]
b = [1]
i = 1 # represents the fibonacci index of b
while len(b) &lt; L:
    # add b to a (a &lt; b is maintained)
    # this is for the step a,b -&gt; b,a+b
    j = 0
    c = 0 # carry
    while j &lt; len(a): # add to existing elements of a
        a[j] += b[j] + c
        if a[j] &gt;= 10: # determine carry
            a[j] -= 10
            c = 1
        else:
            c = 0
        j += 1
    while j &lt; len(b): # if b is longer, a grows
        a.append(b[j] + c)
        if a[j] &gt;= 10:
            a[j] -= 10
            c = 1
        else:
            c = 0
        j += 1
    if c != 0: # carry extends length of 1
        a.append(c)
    # swap to maintain a &lt; b (a,b -&gt; b,a+b)
    a,b = b,a
    i += 1
print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>
    Another way is using the closed form formula for Fibonacci numbers which is:
</p>

\[F_n=\frac{\phi^n-(1-\phi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}
=\frac{\phi^n-(-1)^n\phi^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}
=\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}-\frac{(-1)^n\phi^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}\]

<p>
    Where \(\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\) is the golden ratio. Since \(10^{999}\)
    has 1000 digits, we need to look for \(n\) so that
    \(\log_{10}(F_n)\geq999\). We also observe that \(F_n\) is the closest
    integer to \(\phi^n/\sqrt{5}\) since the other part has absolute value
    smaller than \(1/2\) for any \(n\geq0\). If we assume
    \(F_n=\phi^n/\sqrt{5}\) for simplicity, we need to solve the following
    equation:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
&\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}\geq10^{999} \Rightarrow
n\log_{10}(\phi)-\frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(5)\geq999 \\
&\Rightarrow n\geq\frac{999+\frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(5)}{\log_{10}(\phi)}
\approx4781.859... \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
    This shows that \(\phi^{4782}/\sqrt{5}\) is 1000 digits while
    \(\phi^{4781}/\sqrt{5}\) is 999 digits. The base 10 logarithm of the former
    is \(999.029...\) and of the latter is \(998.820...\). We can be certain
    that rounding \(\phi^n/\sqrt{5}\) to the nearest integer does not change the
    number of digits in these numbers.

<h2>Problem 26</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the positive integer \(d&lt;1000\) for which the
    decimal expansion of \(1/d\) contains the longest repeating cycle.
</p>

<p>
    When doing long division, we start with the \(1\) and have divisor \(d>1\).
    First we write a \(0\), leaving remainder of \(1\) since we try to divide
    \(1\) by \(d\) to determine this digit. At each step, we determine the next
    digit by bringing down a \(0\), so we multiply the remainder by \(10\), then
    divide it by \(d\). At each step, we are keeping track of a remainder from
    division by \(d\).
</p>

<p>
    The next digit can be determined only from the remainder at the previous
    step. Multiply by \(10\), divide by \(d\), and keep the remainder. If the
    remainder reaches \(0\) at some point, the result is not periodic. If it
    does not, then it must cycle with length at most \(d-1\). We could keep
    track of these remainders for up to \(d\) digits in the answer, and know a
    cycle exists at that point, which we can find by going back from the end
    until finding an identical remainder.
</p>

<p>
    A further optimization would be to try starting from the largest \(d=999\)
    and work down. If we have found longest cycle length of \(l\), then we can
    stop once \(d\leq l\) since the longest possible cycle is \(d-1\).

    again for repeated small numbers, it makes sense to cache primes for lookup.
    It is hard to say how many would be a good amount. It may even be helpful to
    adjust the cache size during runtime depending on how high the primes get.
    For simplicity, we will cache primes below 10000 for this problem. Small
    enough numbers will get tested for primality with a sieve and larger numbers
    will get a regular prime test.
</p>

<p>
    We can observe that \(f(0)=b\) must be prime as well as \(f(1)=1+a+b\).
    Optimizing based on this won't help that much though since functions that
    don't start with a prime would be skipped as soon as the first number is
    checked. Other than caching some primes, the rest is fairly straight forward
    brute force.

<h2>Problem 28</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the sum of the diagonal numbers on a \(1001\times1001\)
    spiral formed like the one below:
</p>

<pre style="text-align:center;">
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13
</pre>

<p>
    The spiral is formed by starting at 1 in the center (1x1 spiral). Then we
    get to the next 4 corners by adding 2 4 times (3x3 spiral). Then we add 4
    4 times to get the corners completing the 5x5 spiral. This repetitive
    procedure can get us the answer with some simple code:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
S = 1001
size = 1
step = 2
diagsum = 1
number = 1
while size &lt; S:
    size += 2
    # add the 4 corner numbers
    for _ in range(4):
        number += step
        diagsum += number
    step += 2
print(diagsum)
</code></pre>

<p>
    It turns out we can find a closed form solution for this. Let \(x=1\) for
    the 3x3 ring, \(x=2\) for the 5x5 ring, and so on. Then for some \(x\),
    the corners of the \((2x+1)\times(2x+1)\) ring would be \((2x+1)^2-2xa\)
    for \(a=0,1,2,3\). Adding these 4, we have \(4(2x+1)^2-12x=16x^2+4x+4\). So
    we would sum this from \(x=1\) (3x3) to \(x=500\) (1001x1001) and add the
    1 in the center to get the answer. Here is the formula in terms of \(S\),
    the largest \(x\) for the spiral of variable size.
</p>

\[\begin{align}
&1+\sum_{x=1}^S\left(16x^2+4x+4\right)
=1+\frac{8S(S+1)(2S+1)}{3}+2S(S+1)+4S\\
&=1+\frac{S}{3}\left(8(S+1)(2S+1)+6(S+1)+12\right)
=1+\frac{S}{3}(16S^2+30S+26)
\end{align}\]

<h2>Problem 29</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> How many distinct values of \(a^b\) are there for integers
    \(2\leq a,b\leq100\)?
</p>

<p>
    In Python, with large integer support, we see that \(100^{100}\) isn't too
    big and there are only \(99^2\) values so we can do this with one line where
    we use a set to eliminate duplicates:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
print(len(set(a**b for a in range(2,101) for b in range(2,101))))
</code></pre>

<p>
    Without large integer support, we can use exponent properties. Rewrite each
    \(a^b\) as \((n^p)^b=n^{bp}\) by choosing the smallest integer \(n\)
    possible so we have a "canonical form" of each value. For example, we would
    use \(2^{32}\) instead of \(4^{16}\) and \(7^{18}\) instead of \(49^9\).
    The following code first creates the power rewriting representation for each
    number (the \(n^p\) described), then generates the "canonical form" for all
    possible \(a^b\) and uses a set to remove duplicates.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
L = 100
# express each integer 2,3,..,L as an integer power
intpow = [(n,1) for n in range(L+1)]
p = 2
while 2**p &lt;= L:
    n = 2
    while n**p &lt;= L:
        intpow[n**p] = (n,p)
        n += 1
    p += 1
# make set of (a,b) pairs with a reduced to smallest possible integer
values = set()
for a in range(2,L+1):
    for b in range(2,L+1):
        # rewrite a^b as n^(bp) using a=n^p
        n,p = intpow[a]
        values.add((n,b*p))
print(len(values))
</code></pre>

<p>
    It would also be possible to do this without the extra memory of a set by
    checking alternative representations to see if any others exist and only
    counting it for the representation with the smallest base.

<h2>Problem 30</h2>

<p>
    <b>Problem:</b> Find the sum of all numbers equal to the sum of 5th powers
    of their digits. (Exclude 1 since \(1^5\) is not a sum.)
</p>

<p>
    The first thing we need here is an upper bound. For \(n\) digit numbers, the
    largest sum we can form is \(n\times9^5\). If we have 7 digit numbers, then
    \(7\times9^5&lt;10^6\) so the sum of 5th powers could not even reach the
    smallest 7 digit number. So 6 digits is a bound on length. The largest sum
    we could get with 6 digits is \(6\times9^5=354294\) so we can use this as
    our upper bound. Finally, we can cache the 5th powers to save some
    calculation time and use this brute force solution:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
pow5 = [d**5 for d in range(10)]
total = 0
for n in range(10,6*(9**5)+1):
    powsum = sum(pow5[int(d)] for d in str(n))
    if n == powsum:
        total += n
        print(f'found {n}')
print(total)
