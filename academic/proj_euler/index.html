<h1>Project Euler Solutions Index</h1>

<p>
    I have solutions written for some problems. Below are links to the pages.
    So far it is 10 problems per page. The full problem texts are on
    <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">projecteuler.net</a>.

    As stated on the Project Euler website, "[r]eal learning is an active
    process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that
    epiphany of discovery." I strongly recommend trying to solve the problems
    on your own before looking at solutions. Sometimes we are not going to be
    able to solve every problem on our own, and that is ok. We are going to
    have to look at how to solve problems from time to time, but the important
    thing is to learn more to be able to solve future problems without
    assistance. It is most satisfying when we are able to solve a problem
    entirely on our own. One thing I say is "you know best what you have
    achieved". If you take answers from elsewhere without really understanding
    them, you have achieved nothing.
